# Piercer

A Unity Tetris-like game, made to gain experience with the engine. The first release was completed within a month and I was able to learn a lot during the process.

I still have a few less essential features in mind that I might add in the future.

This project is a personal project made for the enjoyment of learning, it's not intended for commercialization.
